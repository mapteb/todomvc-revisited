# todomvc-revisited

This project explores the use of state machine developed in a [previous project](https://github.com/mapteb/js-state-machine-v2) to the [TodoMVC problem](http://todomvc.com/). Plain vanilla Javascript is used to illustate the idea.

## Source

All the HTML and javascript source needed is in one todoApp.html file.
